# ðŸŽ‰ Hello Developer! Welcome to Code Library Beta ðŸŽ‰

## What is Code Library?
Code Library is your go-to solution for building and documenting your code projects effortlessly. Our platform is designed to simplify your workflow with features like:

- **Simple Drag & Drop**: Upload up to 4 documents at a time with a quick drag and drop.
- **Future Features**: Soon, you'll be able to pass your entire project for thorough documentation.

## How to Get Started

### Step 1: Create Your First Structure
To begin, you need to create a structure for your project:

- **Default Structure**: Start with a default structure that organizes your code in a standard format.
- **Custom Structure During Upload**: You can also create a custom structure when you upload your files. This helps you decide exactly where and how your code will be stored.

### Step 2: Upload Your Files
Once your structure is set up, follow these steps:

- **Upload Files**: Drag and drop the files you want to document into the designated area.
- **Automatic Documentation**: After the files are uploaded, select them to initiate the documentation process. Our powerful AI will generate comprehensive documentation for your code.

## Other Functionalities

### Download Options
- **Single File Download**: Easily download any single file from your project.
- **Complete Directory Download**: With just a click, download an entire directory containing your project files and documentation.
- **Custom Code Download**: Get the generated code along with the documentation.

### Customizing Your Experience
To make the most out of Code Library, you can tailor the process to suit your needs:

- **Create Custom Prompts**: Customize or create your own prompts to guide the AI documentation process. Follow the instructions provided to set up and modify your prompts both before and after converting your documents.

## Additional Features Coming Soon
We're constantly working to enhance Code Library. Hereâ€™s what you can look forward to:

- **Batch Project Documentation**: Soon, you'll be able to pass your entire project at once for batch processing and documentation.
- **Advanced AI Features**: Improved AI capabilities for even more detailed and accurate documentation.
- **Enhanced Customization Options**: More ways to customize the look, feel, and structure of your documentation.

## Tips for Using Code Library
- **Organize Your Files**: Before uploading, ensure your files are well-organized to make the documentation process smoother.
- **Review Generated Documentation**: Always review the AI-generated documentation for accuracy and completeness.
- **Provide Feedback**: Help us improve by providing feedback on your experience and any issues you encounter.

Welcome aboard, and happy coding! ðŸš€
